# My Architecture
-This app helps a user to keep track their favorite buildings in different cities.


-This has  3 models one representing someone using your application (a user), and a city and the buildings which belongs to that city .


-This has complete RESTful routes for the user route with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.


-Axios in React interacts with the database (MongoDB/Mongoose/Express). Promises(Async/Await) are used to build complex queries.
